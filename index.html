  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>With a decade-long journey in software testing, I bring a unique perspective to web development. Proficient in
    full-stack technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and PostgreSQL, my experience in ensuring
    software quality enhances my ability to craft robust and reliable web solutions. Skilled in crafting dynamic user
    interfaces and managing server-side development, I am also well-versed in database operations. Moreover, my
    knowledge of Web3 technologies reflects my readiness to explore emerging paradigms, integrating blockchain solutions
    into web applications. Ready to transition into a web development role, I am committed to delivering innovative and
    impactful web solutions.
